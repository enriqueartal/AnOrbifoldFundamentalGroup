# Orbifold fundamental groups

This notebook is devoted to prove the infiniteness of an orbifold fundamental group. This is the a claim in the paper *Cremona transformations of weighted projective planes, Zariski pairs, and rational cuspidal curves*, joint work with J.I. Cogolludo and J. Martín-Morales, which is part of *Singularities and Their Interaction with Geometry and Low Dimensional Topology In Honor of András Némethi*, 117–157. Birkhäuser, [`doi`: 10.1007/978-3-030-61958-9_7](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61958-9_7). This paper is also available in [`arxiv:2001.07232`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07232).
